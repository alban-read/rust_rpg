# Rust

## No rust is not easy to learn.

When people "Rustaceans" say "Really rust is easy to learn" they may not realize what they are implying.


- "Well, You must be quite a dim bulb, if you can't learn rust".

- "Nothing very hard here, perhaps you better stick with Javascript, or Python".

It is a well known fact that rust is not easy to learn.

Perhaps it was easy for some, but it is not easy for everyone.

I joke that the real reason Rust is good for security is that people like me can not use it.

It is better to admit that learning rust is difficult, and that it is a challenge, than to pretend it is easy.

Most computer languages are not easy to learn, rust is harder than most.

I think the reasons are that, coming from a background of C, C++, and Java, I find the ownership and borrowing model of rust to be quite different.

In fact, it is astonishingly and surprisingly different.

What other languages remove access to a variable, because you used it a function?

I am not saying this in a negative way, these are great, innovative, and useful features of the language and its compiler.

Also, while I have no knowledge of how rust was designed, it also feels like it includes a pragmatic hodgepodge of features from other languages.

It does not have a clean core philosophy, it is not completely built around the lambda calculus, or the object model, or the functional model, or the procedural model.

It is a mix of all of these, and more.

Language types go through fads of popularity, for example object-oriented programming was very popular in the 1990s, and functional programming is very popular now.

It seems like rust was designed mid-way between these trends.

So we have some really cool functional features, like pattern matching, and some really cool object-oriented features, like traits.

But it is not a pure functional language, or a pure object-oriented language.

It is a mix of both.

It even makes for a pretty good procedural language, to replace something like Modula-2, pascal or C.

And of course it is a low-level systems programming language, but seems to have more in common with the high-level languages.

So there is a mix of features, like algebraic data types, and generics, and lifetimes, and ownership, and borrowing, and traits, and pattern matching, and closures, and iterators, and async/await, and so on.
Some of them are unique and some are inspired by other languages, but what a mix.

The algebraic data types are like Haskell, the lifetimes are like C++ (RAII), the ownership and borrowing are unique, the traits are somewhat like interfaces, the pattern matching is like Haskell, the closures are like JavaScript, the iterators are like Python, the async/await is like JavaScript, and so on.

Rust also uses its own terminology, and reuses some terms in different ways.  

Some of these ideas, are not easy to learn, and some of them are not easy to use.

That is my view, but what does Copilot think?

Rust is often considered a challenging language to learn for several reasons:  
- Ownership and Borrowing: Rust introduces unique concepts like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. These concepts are fundamental to Rust's memory safety guarantees, but they can be difficult to grasp, especially for beginners.  
- Strict Compiler: Rust's compiler is notoriously strict. While this leads to more secure and reliable code, it can also be frustrating for new learners because the code will not compile until it meets the compiler's strict criteria.  
- Syntax: Rust's syntax can be quite different from other popular languages like JavaScript, Python, or Java. This difference can make the initial learning curve steeper.  
- Concurrency: Rust's approach to concurrency is safe and efficient but can be complex to understand and implement correctly.  
- Error Handling: Rust uses a system of Result and Option types for error handling, which can be a shift from the exception-based systems in many other languages.  
- Advanced Type System: Rust has a rich and advanced type system. It includes features like traits and generics, which can be difficult to understand for beginners.

Design considerations 

Tiles

Tile Representation:

Each tile represents a discrete unit of the game world.
Define a Tile struct that holds information about the tileâ€™s type (e.g., wall, floor, door), contents (characters, items, bags), and other properties (safe zone, spawn point, etc.).
Tile Grid:
Create a 2D grid (array or vector of vectors) to represent the entire game world.
Each cell in the grid corresponds to a tile.
Initialize the grid with default tiles (e.g., empty floor tiles).
Tile Properties:
Add fields to the Tile struct to store relevant information (e.g., tile type, contents, spawn points).
Consider using an enum for different tile types (e.g., Wall, Floor, Door).

World Map

Map Generation Algorithm:

Implement an algorithm to generate the world map.
Decide the size of the map (number of tiles in width and height).
Use procedural generation techniques (e.g., Perlin noise, cellular automata) to create terrain features (forests, mountains, etc.).
Terrain Types:
Define different terrain types (e.g., grassland, desert, water).
Assign each tile a terrain type based on the generated map.

Tile Placement:

Place tiles in the grid according to the generated map.
Set specific tiles as spawn points, safe zones, or dangerous zones.
Item and NPC Placement:
Use the same algorithm to determine where items, NPCs, and monsters spawn.
Populate the map with relevant entities based on the generated data.
Rendering

2D Rendering:

Use a 2D graphics library (e.g., bevy, ggez, or piston) to render the game.
Render each tile as a sprite or texture on the screen.
Map the grid coordinates to screen coordinates for rendering.
Camera and Viewport:
Implement a camera system to control the view of the world.
Define a viewport that displays a portion of the world map.
Update the viewport based on player movement or exploration.
Layering:

Render tiles in layers (background, midground, foreground).
Ensure that tiles are drawn in the correct order (e.g., walls behind characters).
Dynamic Rendering:
Update the rendering when the player moves or interacts with the world.
Handle animations (e.g., water animation, character movement).

Mutability 

Character Attributes:
Consider making character attributes (health, mana, etc.) mutable.
These values change frequently during gameplay.
Use mutability for efficient updates.

Game World Tiles:
Tiles representing terrain, objects, and spawn points can be immutable.
Once generated, they remain constant during gameplay.
Immutable tiles simplify rendering and collision detection.

Entity Components:
Use immutability for components shared across entities.
Immutable components ensure thread safety.
For example, position and velocity components.

Game State:
The overall game state (player positions, scores, etc.) can be mutable.
Frequent updates occur during gameplay.
Use locks or other synchronization mechanisms for thread safety.

Rendering:
Immutable data for rendering (textures, sprites) is preferable.
Avoid modifying rendering data during gameplay.
Mutable data can be used for dynamic effects (e.g., particle systems).
